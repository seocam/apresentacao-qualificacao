abstract = {Users accessing different but comparable web sites of some organizations, e.g., different departments of a university, expect them to have comparable content and provide for comparable ways to navigate through the content. To ensure such a similar look and feel, organizations may either define strict design rules to be met across all its web sites, with no room for site-specific modifications or, which is also frequent, only provide for a common entry point to entirely different sub-sites. Web Site Families offer a design approach that balances these two extremes. They allow specifying general requirements and they support site-specific modifications in that the general requirements can be specialized. Web Site Families organize related web sites in a hierarchy in which common design requirements for members at a lower level (e.g., department web site) are defined at the higher level (e.g., faculty level). Members at the lower level may specialize "inherited" requirements through extension, i.e., adding new links and pages, and refinement, i.e, replacing links or pages through a set of linked pages. The paper introduces navigation consistency as a design criterion that ensures that the specialized navigation requirements of a web site model adhere to the general navigation requirements of a more general web site model. Two kinds of navigation consistency are distinguished: Observation consistency, ensuring that any navigation according to the more specific model is observable as a correct navigation according to the more general model, and invocation consistency, ensuring that any link traversal (navigation) according to the more general model is also valid for the more specific model and achieves the expected effect. To assist web site developers and users, the paper presents necessary and sufficient rules to check for observation consistency and invocation consistency between navigation models of web site families.

Web 2.0 is the network as platform, spanning all connected devices; Web 2.0 applications are those that make the most of the intrinsic advantages of that platform: delivering software as a continually-updated service that gets better the more people use it, consuming and remixing data from multiple sources, including individual users, while providing their own data and services in a form that allows remixing by others, creating network effects through an architecture of participation, and going beyond the page metaphor of Web 1.0 to deliver rich user experiences.},

abstract = {Fragment-based caching has been proposed as a promising technique for dynamic Web content delivery and caching [2, 3, 4]. Most of these approaches either assume the fragment-based content is served by Web server automatically, or look at server-side caching only. There is no method of extracting fragments from an existing dynamic Web content, which is of great importance to the success of fragment-based caching. Also, current technologies for supporting dynamic fragments do not allow to take into account changes in fragment spatiality, which is a popular technique in dynamic and personalized Web site design. This paper describes our effort to address these shortcomings. The first, DyCA, a Dynamic Content Adapter, is a tool for creating fragment-based content from original dynamic content. Our second proposal is an augmentation to the ESI standard that will allow it to support looking up fragment locations in a mapping table that comes attached with the template. This allows the fragments to move across the document without needing to reserve the template.},

abstract = {The development of user interfaces (UIs) is one of the most timeconsuming aspects in software development. In this context, the lack of proper reuse mechanisms for UIs is increasingly becoming manifest, especially as software development is more and more moving toward composite applications. In this paper we propose a framework for the integration of stand-alone modules or applications, where integration occurs at the presentation layer. Hence, the final goal is to reduce the effort required for UI development by maximizing reuse. The design of the framework is inspired by lessons learned from application integration, appropriately modified to account for the specificity of the UI integration problem. We provide an abstract component model to specify characteristics and behaviors of presentation components and propose an event-based composition model to specify the composition logic. Components and composition are described by means of a simple XML-based language, which is interpreted by a runtime middleware for the execution of the resulting composite application. A proof-ofconcept prototype allows us to show that the proposed component model can also easily be applied to existing presentation components, built with different languages and/or component technologies.},

@article{Takada2012,
abstract = {Modern authentication mechanisms, including Shibboleth and OAuth, provide user attributes such as affiliations and e-mail addresses. Conventional collaborative methods have problems using such attributes in egress access control for the Web. This paper proposes a new collaborative method using Web browsers, proxy servers, and authentication servers. The proposed method simplifies communications among these elements by using a trusted shared repository that stores user attributes. A new authentication mechanism can be added to the system by deploying an authentication server of the new authentication mechanism. This authentication server is a Web application and stores user attributes in a shared repository associated with the user identifiers. When proxy servers receive requests from Web browsers, the proxy servers retrieve user attributes from the shared repository and the proxy servers decide whether or not to allow access to external Web pages in accordance with the URLs and relevant user attributes. Unlike in a standard such as the Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO), neither Web browsers nor proxy servers are required to include extensions for authentication mechanisms. On the basis of the simple collaborative method, the authors have implemented an egress access control system for the Web that performs user authentication with Shibboleth and Facebook. The access control system has been operational in a university library for more than a year.},
